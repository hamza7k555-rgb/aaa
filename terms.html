            <a class="main-h1">Terms of Service</a>
            <a class="main-a">These Terms of Service ("TOS") govern your use of the hosting services provided by
                Wispbyte ("Wispbyte"). By accessing or using our services, you agree to comply with these terms and
                conditions.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Age Restrictions</a>
            <a class="main-a">1.1. By using our services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to use or access our services.</a>
            <a class="main-a">1.2. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only use our services with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service.</a>
            <a class="main-a">1.3. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any time to verify compliance with these age restrictions.</a>
            <a class="main-a">1.4. Any violation of these age restrictions may result in immediate termination of your account and access to our services.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Account Setup and Security</a>
            <a class="main-a">2.1. You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to immediately notify Wispbyte of any unauthorized use or breach of security.</a>
            <a class="main-a">2.2. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account. Wispbyte shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Service Usage and Restrictions</a>
            <a class="main-a">3.1. You agree to use Wispbyte's services in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and these terms.</a>
            <a class="main-a">3.2. You shall not engage in any activity that may disrupt or interfere with the proper functioning of Wispbyte's services or networks.</a>
            <a class="main-a">3.3. Wispbyte reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account, without prior notice, if your usage violates these terms or poses a risk to the integrity or security of our systems.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Payment and Refunds</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.1. Wispbyte offers both free and paid hosting services. Free accounts are subject to certain limitations as specified on our website.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.2. For paid accounts, you agree to pay all fees and charges associated with the selected hosting plan. Payment details, including billing cycle and payment methods, will be outlined during the account setup process.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.3. EU Consumer Law Notice – Digital Services: Under the EU Consumer Rights Directive, consumers typically have a 14‑day right of withdrawal for distance purchases. However, this right does <strong>not</strong> apply to digital services once performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent and acknowledgment that they lose the right of withdrawal once performance begins. By activating or using our services immediately after purchase, you expressly request early performance and acknowledge that the standard withdrawal right does not apply.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.4. <strong>48‑hour unconditional refund:</strong> Within 48 hours of initial purchase or account activation, you may request a full refund for any reason (excluding non‑recoverable transaction fees). No justification is required during this period.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.5. <strong>14‑day limited refund window:</strong> Beyond the initial 48‑hour period and up to 14 days from purchase, refunds are available only where you experience a persistent service fault attributable to Wispbyte's infrastructure (for example, sustained platform outages or network failures that prevent reasonable use of the service) and we are unable to remedy the issue within a reasonable time.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.6. Exclusions (applies to 14‑day period only): After the 48‑hour unconditional period, refunds are not available for (i) issues caused by user configuration, code, workload, or third‑party dependencies; (ii) violations of these Terms, Fair Use, or Acceptable Use; (iii) scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, or external upstream incidents; (iv) non‑refundable add‑ons or pass‑through fees (e.g., payment processor charges, domain costs); or (v) services already canceled by the user.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.7. How to request: For 48‑hour refunds, simply open a ticket at <strong>billing.wispbyte.com</strong>. For 14‑day refunds, provide logs or details showing the infrastructure fault (timestamps, affected services, steps to reproduce). We may request reasonable cooperation to investigate and remediate before issuing a decision.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.8. Calculation: Approved refunds are issued to the original payment method where possible and may be prorated and/or net of non‑recoverable fees (e.g., processor fees, promotional discounts). Processing times may vary by provider.</a>
            <a class="main-a">4.9. Abuse & compliance: We may decline or revoke refunds for misuse, fraudulent activity, excessive chargebacks, or breach of these Terms. Nothing in this section limits statutory rights that cannot be excluded under applicable law.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Content and Intellectual Property</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.1. You agree not to host or transmit any content that is illegal, infringing, obscene, defamatory, or violates the rights of any third party.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.2. Wispbyte reserves the right to remove or suspend any content that violates these terms or infringes upon the rights of others.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.3. Wispbyte retains the right to review and assess any content hosted or transmitted on its platform if deemed suspicious or potentially violating these terms. In such cases, Wispbyte may, at its discretion, conduct a thorough examination of the content to ensure compliance with the stipulated guidelines. This includes but is not limited to investigating potential illegal activities, infringement issues, obscenity, or defamation concerns.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.4. Users agree to cooperate with any review initiated by Wispbyte and provide necessary information or clarification regarding the content in question. Failure to cooperate may result in the removal or suspension of the content in question without further notice.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.5. Wispbyte reserves the right to take appropriate actions, including the removal or suspension of content, based on the outcome of the review process, to maintain the integrity of its platform and uphold the rights of third parties.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Website Review and Security Monitoring</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.6. Wispbyte will automatically review websites being hosted on our platform using software that may or may not include artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This automated review process is designed to ensure that no one hosts phishing websites, malware, or other dangerous content on our platform.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.7. The automated review system may analyze website content, URLs, file structures, and other technical aspects to identify potentially harmful or illegal content. This includes but is not limited to phishing attempts, malware distribution, illegal content, or activities that violate these Terms of Service.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.8. In cases where our automated systems or manual review identifies content that violates these terms, poses a security risk, or is potentially illegal, Wispbyte reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate the hosting service and account access.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.9. Users who violate these terms by hosting prohibited content, including but not limited to phishing websites, malware, or other dangerous content, will have their accounts permanently suspended and may be reported to appropriate authorities.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.10. Wispbyte will cooperate with law enforcement and other appropriate authorities when required by law or when we believe such cooperation is necessary to protect our users, our platform, or the general public from harm.</a>
            <a class="main-a">5.11. By using our services, you acknowledge and consent to this automated review process and understand that violation of these terms may result in permanent suspension of your account and potential legal consequences.</a>
        
            <a class="main-h2">Disclaimer of Warranties</a>
            <a class="main-a">6.1. Wispbyte provides its services on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied.</a>
